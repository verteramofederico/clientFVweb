      <p>During the period of isolation inspiration has come. Homero Tolosa and Federico Verteramo, companions for years in different groups, materialized this spontaneous partnership to shape an EP with curious peculiarities.&nbsp;</p>      <p>The new release available on all platforms consists of <em>¨My baby is a good´un¨, ¨You’re killing my love¨ and ¨Right Place Wrong Time¨</em>. This last song has been pre-released in a video clip and featured the stellar participation of <em>Brazilian Igor Prado</em>, one of the most prominent guitarists of the genre of the last 20 years.. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNWdwSrIKd0" target="_blank"><em>Link to videoclip</em></a></p>
      <p>Composed of four <strong>original songs</strong>, the lyrics seek to portray the feelings that we experience during this period of quarantine.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>¨At night we would connect via WhatsApp and after defining a melody as a starting point we would get to work on the message and the lyrics for the song¨&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>¨We felt strong inspiration and enthusiasm. We used it to write four songs together in five days¨&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p>Recorded from home and with absolutely limited equipment, adding musicians to achieve a traditional band sound meant work that, technically, could not be carried out in a reasonable time.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The inspiration for the search for sound and style came then from artists who throughout history have developed using only a guitar and drums: RL Burnside, Junior Kimbrough, Robert Belfour, representatives of the Mississippi Hill Country Blues, as well as also in more modern ones like The Black Keys, Jack White, Shawn Pittman and Cedric Burnside as well as in the sound of the Fat Possum label.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>¨Although we had strong inspirations, the search for sound and own style has been a premise. For weeks we spent listening to the musicians of the style and passing music to each other, but the identities and baggage of each one are always there¨&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>¨We understand that we are artists who live and play in the year 2020. We wanted the stories we tell to be inspired by the artists we like, but mainly, that they are fed by our way of interpreting¨&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p>As a guest musician, Adrian Jimenez, an undisputed leader of the harmonica, currently based in Madrid participates in a song.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong><em>Motivations for releasing a quarantined EP:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
      <p>Being able to continue working on our music was absolutely revitalizing in this very special period. The priority from the beginning has been not so much taking care of technical issues but making music in the most sincere, direct and emotional way possible.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>¨When the covid crisis started I was going through my last weeks in Buenos Aires. I was about to start a tour with more than 40 concerts in Europe to finally settle to live in France to continue developing artistically¨ Federico&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p><em>¨I remember that we had a conversation in which Fede was telling me that he felt discouraged in the face of the suspension of his trip to Europe, and the&nbsp;phrase “we must not abandon dreams” came up, which is part of the song wich gives name to the EP. In less than a month we had 4 songs composed and recorded, a creative overflow full of mixed feelings that exploded in the form of catharsis¨ Homero&nbsp;</em></p>
      <p>The process, which included song composition, layout, recording, mixing and mastering, took a total of 27 days.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The equipment used was not more than the usual and personal use that we had at our disposal: Federico with a laptop and a dynamic microphone and Homero with a journalist-style portable recorder.&nbsp;</p>
